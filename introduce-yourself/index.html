          I'm a computer science student who's all about learning how things
          work, whether that's code, cars, or computers. I like taking stuff
          apart, figuring out why it works (or doesn't), and putting it back
          together better than before.

          This site is part of a class project, but
          also a fun way to show what I'm into. You'll find a page about my car
          projects and another about my favorite games, basically the two things
          that eat up most of my free time.
