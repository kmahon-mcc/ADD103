          Gaming has always been one of my favorite ways to unwind and dive into
          new worlds. I love story-driven games like God of War, ones that mix
          action, emotion, and amazing visuals. Whether I'm exploring epic
          landscapes or just grinding out levels, gaming gives me a mix of
          challenge and escape that keeps me coming back.

          I've been building my own gaming and programming PC from the ground
          up, and it's been a blast. Picking out each part and putting it all
          together is super satisfying. I love having a setup that's tuned
          exactly how I like it, whether I'm coding, gaming, or pushing hardware
          to its limits.
