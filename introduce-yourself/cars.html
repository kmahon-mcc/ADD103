              This shot's from my time working as a professional automotive
              technician. I've spent countless hours under the hood diagnosing
              issues, replacing parts, and learning how every system connects.
              It's hands-on work that constantly teaches me something new, and
              there's nothing better than hearing an engine roar back to life
              after a tough fix.

            <p>
              This is where the fun happens, my own toolbox for working on
              personal projects. I'm always looking for ways to tweak, tune, or
              improve my cars, whether it's adding new parts, upgrading
              performance, or just experimenting. Modding keeps me creative and
              makes every drive feel like my own custom build.

            <p>
              Car shows are one of my favorite ways to spend a weekend. I love
              seeing the craftsmanship behind every build, from the raw frames
              like this one to the fully tuned monsters on display. It's cool
              getting up close to the engineering that makes these cars special
              and picking up new ideas for my own projects.
